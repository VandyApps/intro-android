project brainstorming!
======================

As the culmination of this lecture series, we want you guys to produce a real life android application! This can be as simple or as complex as you like -- we want you to make something you'll be excited about and that you'll learn something from. If you already have an idea, GREAT! Let us know what it is and we can answer any questions you have and help you along the way. The listing of projects everyone is doing will be maintained [here](../README.md#Projects). The below are some types of apps you can work on if you're having trouble thinking of something you're interested in making.
