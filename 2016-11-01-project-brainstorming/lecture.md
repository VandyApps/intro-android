project brainstorming!
======================

As the culmination of this lecture series, we want you guys to produce a real life android application! This can be as simple or as complex as you like -- we want you to make something you'll be excited about and that you'll learn something from. If you already have an idea, GREAT! Let us know what it is and we can answer any questions you have and help you along the way. The listing of projects everyone is doing will be maintained [here](../README.md#projects). The below are some types of apps you can work on if you're having trouble thinking of something you're interested in making.

# Possible Categories
- [games](#games)
- [quantified life](#quantified-life)
- [API interface](#api-interface)
- [tools](#tools)

This is not exhaustive! If you have an idea, but you're not sure if it'll work or how to get it going, ask Chris or me! **THERE ARE NO DUMB IDEAS.** Remember that we're always on [slack](https://vandyapps.slack.com/messages/intro-android/), and we can always set up one-on-one meetings or hold office hours! Let us know if either of those would interest you.

## Games

### Examples
- real-time
    - RPG
    - racing
    - FPS
- strategy
    - StarCraft
    - LoL
- puzzle
    - Monument Valley
- skill
    - tetris
    - [simon says](../2016-09-27-simon-says/)

### Challenges
- dynamically updating UI
- 3D, if applicable
- creating game content
    - e.g. music, levels, artwork
    - this is not 100% necessary! point is to learn how to write apps, not make the best game ever

## Quantified Life

Apps which track some part of the user's lifestyle in a way which would be annoying to do manually.

### Examples
- fitbit
- sleep tracker
- calorie counter

### Challenges
- need to make interaction quick and seamless, otherwise app is annoying to use and users won't put all the data into it that they need to make it most effective
    - e.g. if it takes more than 5 seconds to put in the number of hours slept, users won't enter it when they wake up, and less likely to accurately track sleep
- need to visualize data collected by app, or process in some useful way
    - i.e. in addition to just collecting data, need to present some interesting way to understand it

## API Interface

Apps which allow users to view data from and interact with some web API. These can be very basic (database viewers) or very complex (social media apps).

### Examples
- social media apps
- weather/stock apps
- bank apps
- database viewer

### Challenges
- need to allow user to interact with / understand data from API
    - interface must be complex enough to expose API, but simple to use
    - otherwise user could just manually write http requests
- need to learn API and update app when API changes if it's not your API

## Tools

Apps which perform a service for the user not covered by the above.

### Examples
- flashlight
- calculator
- photo editor

### Challenges
- interacting with phone hardware, if applicable
- may need to use external library for complex operations (e.g. photo editing)
