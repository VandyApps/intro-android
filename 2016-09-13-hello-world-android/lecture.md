Hello World!
============

*Lecture given on 2016-09-13.*

# Before Lecture

## Install Android Studio
- Install android studio: https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

## Hello World App
- Go through this tutorial (https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) through the *Running Your Application* section.
- If you can't get the emulator to start up, talk to me. I spent an incredibly painful hour getting it to work.

# Lecture

## screwing around with android studio!
- i found it much more difficult to set up my hello world project than i expected, so this will be shorter than usual
- we'll go over the structure of the code and screw around a little
- then we'll help you get set up
- this lecture folder DOESN'T have code because we want you guys to set it up yourself
    - all later lectures with code will have code in the repo

## modifying activity layout
- activity layout (usually) controlled by xml
    - can be controlled in java code too -- we'll go over this later
- "view" mode and "xml" mode
- we'll change a few things

## structure of the codebase
- manifests
- java
- res
- tests
- other stuff

# After Lecture
## Android Studio
- at this point, you NEED to have this installed and to be able to create a hello world app!
- you WON'T be able to follow along if you don't do this
- if you are having difficulties, WE CAN HELP! ping us on slack (vandyapps.slack.com, #intro-android) and Chris and I will help you
