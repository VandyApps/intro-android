## Simon Says
- time-based "whack-a-mole" type game
- screen has 4 colored buttons
- at beginning of a round, a message is displayed saying which color to press
- user has a specified amount of time to press the right color
- if user presses the right color, advance to next round with less time
- if user presses wrong color or fails to do it in time, game over
- score is average time per round
